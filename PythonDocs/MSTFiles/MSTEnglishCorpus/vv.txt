rich and well-developed	bibliography? We must first of all understand that this settlement, Santa Maria, established in
1993, is, as the author admits from the start, an exceptional and nonrepresentative case within	the movement	as a whole.	It was	intended	to test the possibility	of an
innovative producer-cooperative	in a locality specially selected by the directors of the MST at the state level, with its leadership hand-picked as members who had already
played a significant role in the movement and had shown a desire to follow a differ ent path from the usual one by returning to the countryside after having lived in town.

of	their	connection	with	what	has	been	happening	in	rural	areas	in Europe.	The	state is known for its tradition of coffee cultivation in the north and of small farms in the southeast and east. It is also characterized by significant waves of migration into the countryside when coffee cultivation was expanding in the 1940s, away from the
countryside and into the cities from the 1970s onward, from the countryside to new
agricultural areas being opened up in Brazil and Paraguay during the various crises of the agricultural economy, and then away from the land again when this was

to rural trade unions, and operates rather deliberately. The first land occupation in Paran? took place in 1984, and the state capital, Curitiba, became the venue for the First Landless Workers' Conference, marked by its supporters' camping out as a his
toric protest demonstration right in the middle of town. The author has thus chosen a state with a wealth of experience that is central to the history of the MST. At the end of the 1980s, with the rise of the Uni?o Democr?tica Ruralista (Democratic
Countryside	Alliance?UDR),	which	represents	the	landowners'	response	to MST tactics, and with the election in late 1989 of Fernando Collor to the presidency of Brazil	over	the	Partido	dos	Trabalhadores	(Workers'	party?PT)	candidate,	the	state
MST	turned	strongly	inward,	consolidating	its	settlements,	organizing	production, and securing the political space that it had already won. This is the context out of
which the idea of the Santa Maria settlement The most obvious richness of Fanelli's work lies, then, in the suggestion that these
general	processes	do	not	take	into	account	the multitude	of	pathways	and	choices	that led precisely these families and these individuals to the experience of cooperative pro
duction just outside the city of Paran?, in the north of the state. For Fanelli, it is neces sary to understand the element of planning and choice that has caused many peasants who had already left the countryside for towns to decide to go back to the country, start ing with their evaluation of the negative side of town life but chiefly the result of a con
scious political choice in which the central element has been the opportunity for an
experience	of	cooperative	production	as	a middle	way	between	small-scale	capitalist production and a wider social program that could point to an alternative to capitalism.
Hence the title of his book, "Opting for the Land." It is, however, in the intersection of these two elements that Fanelli's work finds
its natural limitations. Analyzing the paths of people's lives and the concrete experi ence of the Santa Maria settlement fills a whole chapter of this book with humanity and comes across as its greatest contribution, providing a story in opposition to the

usual	demonization	of	these	men,	women,	and	children	fighting	splendidly	for	their survival and dignity. Over and above this, the story of Santa Maria, although atypi
cal, contradicts	the reactionary	assumption	that any type of alternative	experience	in
rural Brazil is impossible. This is, however, as far as the book's contribution goes. Without	diminishing	it, we	must	recognize	that	its	analysis	is	insufficient	to	answer the book's opening question, "Can there be any balance between town and country other than the one offered by the highly industrialized countries?" Any valid answer
would have to go far beyond the heroic experience of the Santa Maria settlers. The book could, however, be used in Brazilian classrooms to provide an alternative to
the dominant but distorted vision spread by the mass media of the rich experience of struggle and resistance undergone by those Brazilians who have chosen to swim
against	the prevailing	current.
