The crisis and challenges faced by labor, including the trade unions and social movements have proportions not yet fully un- derstood. The repercussions, owing to globalization, also reached Third World countries, especially intermediate countries that hold important industrial estates such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, etc. Brazil is part of an economic, social, political and cultural context which has universal traces of global capitalism, but also possesses singularities. During the last decades, Brazilian trade unions and social movements have either followed a di􏰀erent path. There was a widespread and highly signi®cant strike movement 􏰁in the 1980s) with a notable expansion of trade unions organizing salaried sector 􏰁teachers, bank workers, public sector workers, etc.);therewasalsotheriseoftheUnionCongressessuchastheCUT-CentralU􏰃nicadosTrabalhadores􏰁WorkersCentral)andthe advance of rural unionism and the Landless Workers' Movement 􏰁MST, Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra) and new urban social movements such as the Homeless Movement. By the end of these decades, we joined in a more signi®cant way the challenges which were presented to the unionism and social movements. These challenges are discuss in this paper.

1. Introduction
My objective in this paper is to present the main changes occurring in the world of labor, in the new trade union movement and social movements in Brazil in re- centyears,especiallyinviewofthetransformationof today's capitalist system that has impacted on Taylorist and Fordist industries. If, since the 1970s, these changes hit the most advanced capitalist economies, due to the con®guration of the capitalist system at a global level, in Brazil these changes greatly intensi®ed throughout the 1990s with the government of Fernando Collor de Mello and, later, of Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
This paper will proceed as follows. In the ®rst part, I will present the more general tendencies that have been a trademark of the so-called capitalist restructuring, em- phasizing the latter's main characteristics. In particular, I will analyze the impact of the Japanese model 􏰁or Toyotism) on the restructuring of capital in the West. In addition, I will also analyze, in general terms, the main consequences of this process for the world of labor. In

the second part, I will show how these transformations have a􏰀ected capitalism in Brazil, causing it to change its basic characteristics. I will show how these economic, political and ideological changes have also a􏰀ected Brazil's new trade unionism, comparing conditions in the1980s±whentheCentralU􏰃nicadosTrabalhadores 􏰁CUT) and the new trade unionism were born ± to those in the 1990s. Finally, in the conclusion, I will re ̄ect on the main challenges to Brazil's new trade unionism as well as the rising importance of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement 􏰁Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem-Terra, MST) and new social movements in the re- newal and progress of social action in Brazil.
As it has evolved during the last decades, contem- porary capitalism has accentuated many tendencies of its destructive logic; this has strongly a􏰀ected the world of labor. The pattern of capitalist accumulation, struc- tured by the duality of Taylorism and Fordism, has in- creasingly changed, mixed or even been substituted by more  ̄exible and deregulated productive forms, of which the so-called  ̄exible accumulation and the Jap- anese model, or Toyotism, are examples.
Synthetically, we see this duality, Fordism/Taylorism, as an expression of a productive system and its

respective work processes ± based on mass production and responsible for more homogeneous production ± that dominated large industry during a good part of the 20th century. This duality was characterized by the in- terweaving of assembly line production with the Tay- lorist time e􏰂ciency, as well as being based on piecework and fragmentation, with a clear demarcation line between conception and execution. This productive process and work, based on large concentrated and vertical industries, resulted in the mass-worker, the collective worker, in highly hierarchical large businesses.
In the same way, the welfare state, that sustained the social-democratic model in various capitalist developed countries, comes under question by privatizing and anti- social neo-liberal deregulation. Having its material base in the productive restructuring of capital, the neo-liberal project took on unique forms and caused various capi- talist countries to reorganize their productive world, seeking to combine elements of the neo-liberal creed with the restructuring of productive capital.
It was in this context that the process of capitalist expansion in Japan, under way in that country since the post-1945 period, emerged forcefully on the Western world. Since the 1970s, Toyotism has presented itself as the most structured productive prescription o􏰀ered by capital as a possible cure for its structural crisis. Re- sponsible for a vigorous return to capitalism in Japan, Toyotism, or the ``Japanese model'', can be understood, summarily, as an organizational form of labor that is born in the Toyota factory in post-war Japan. It di􏰀ers basically from Fordism in the following ways:
1. It is production connected to demand. 2. It is varied and considerably heterogeneous. 3. It is based on team work, with multi-faceted functions. 4. It has as its basic principle just in time, the greatest
possible use of time in production and functions ac- cording to the system of kan-ban, signs or command codes for replacement of parts and stock, which in Toyotism should be kept to a minimum. While in a Fordist factory almost 75% of the ®nal product was produced within the same plant, in a Toyotist factory only about 25% of the ®nal product is produced with- in the same plant. It has a horizontal productive pro- cess and transfers to third parties a great part of what was previously produced within the factory 􏰁see Hi- rata, 1993; Coriat, 1992; Antunes, 1995).
This development path of contemporary Japanese capitalism shows, to the West, how a possible alternative can be incorporated by capital, with more or less mod- i®cations in relation to the original project. It was from a basis in various capital experiments, from the Japanese way to the experience in the USA 􏰁California), from the North of Italy to the Swedish experience, among many others, but having Toyotism as its boldest project, that capital redesigned its productive processes 􏰁see Harvey, 1989). Because of the actual telos that drives these ten-
dencies, that are, in reality, responses of capital to its structural crises 􏰁of a continuous and deepening de- pressive e􏰀ect), the destructive elements that direct its logic are accentuated. The greater the increase in com- petitiveness and inter-capital competition, the more di- sastrous are the consequences of which, as I said earlier, two manifestations are particularly virulent and grave: the destruction and/or precariousness, without parallel in the modern era, of the labor force of which structural unemployment is the major example; and the growing degradation, which destroys the environment, of the organic relationship between humans and nature, di- rected by a social logic concerned primarily with the production of goods and the process of capital accu- mulation 􏰁see M􏰃esz􏰃aros, 1995; Bihr, 1991; Kurz, 1992).
In the daily struggle to expand to the parts of the world that interest them and, at the same time, to manage the crises, capitalists wind up bringing even more destruction and uncertainty. Latin America be- comes ``part'' of this so-called globalization, socially destroying itself. From Argentina to Mexico, passing through Colombia and Peru, the levels of social im- poverishment speak for themselves. In Asia, this enormous expansion occurs at the cost of a brutal super- exploitation of labor, of which the strike of the metal workers in South Korea, in 1997, is a ®rm denunciation. Super-exploitation also profoundly a􏰀ects women and children.
This situation, whose more serious problems we only highlight here, had enormous consequences in the world of labor. Here we can only indicate the most important ones: 1. Reduction in manual, factory, ``stable'' labor force,
typical of Taylorism/Fordism and of the expansion
phase of vertical and concentrated industry. 2. The accentuated increase in the new proletariat, in the innumerable ways of sub-proletarization or desta- bilization of labor, resulting from the expansion of part-time, temporary, sub-contracted, contracted out labor, and which has intensi®ed on a world scale, as much in Third World countries as in the developed
capitalist countries. 3. An expressive increase in female labor within the
working class, also on a world scale, an increase which has principally supplied 􏰁though not exclu- sively) work that is precarious, sub-contracted, tem- porary, part-time, etc.
4. The enormous expansion of middle-salaried workers, especially in the ``service sector'' that, initially grew on a large scale, but has also witnessed levels of tech- nological unemployment.
5. Exclusion of young and old workers, according to the de®nition of capital 􏰁around 40 years of age) from the labor market in the developed capitalist countries.
6. Intensi®cation and super-exploitation of labor, with the brutalized utilization of immigrant workers, as
well as the expansion in the levels of child labor, un- der criminal conditions, in so many parts of the world like Asia, Latin America, etc.
7. There is, on explosive levels, a process of structural unemployment that, if summed up with precarious work, part-time, temporary, etc., a􏰀ects about 1 bil- lion workers, around one-third of the world's human labor force;
These elements ± only indicated here in their most generic tendencies ± do not make it possible to attribute validity to the thesis about the end of labor under the capitalist mode of production. This is still more evident when considering that two-thirds of the labor force is found in the so-called Third World, where the tenden- cies, pointed out previously, have a very particular and di􏰀erentiated character. Restricting oneself to Germany or France, and making generalizations about the end of labor or of the working class, ignoring what happens in countries like India, China, Brazil, Mexico, South Ko- rea, Russia, Argentina, etc., not to speak of Japan, is an error of great signi®cance. It is worth adding that the thesis of the end of the working class, even when re- stricted to the developed capitalist countries, is, in our opinion, without foundation, neither empirical nor an- alytical. A broader notion of labor, which takes into account its multi-faceted character, is much needed as a forceful response to this evidence.
2. Industrial restructuring in Brazil
When one re ̄ects upon the transformations through which the world of labor of the developed capitalist countries has passed and their repercussions and paral- lels with those practiced in Brazil, it is necessary to take into consideration mediating factors. Brazil is part of an economic, social, political and cultural context that has universal traces of global capitalism but has singularities that need to be understood. Here, an important concern is with an unequally combined globality that should not permit an acritical or epiphenomenal identi®cation be- tween what happens in the central countries and the subordinated countries.
Capitalism in Brazil, particularly its pattern of in- dustrial accumulation developed since the mid-1950s and intensi®ed during the period after the military coup of 1964, has a a dual productive structure. On the one hand, it is structured for the production of durable consumer goods, such as automobiles, electric appli- ances, etc., for a selective and restricted internal market composed of the dominant classes and a signi®cant part of the middle classes, especially in the higher strata. On the other, there is the production for export, not only of raw materials, but also industrialized consumer prod- ucts. The increasing erosion of workers' salaries made levels of accumulation that attracted monopolist capital
possible. In this way, the industrial capitalist expansion was sustained 􏰁and is still sustained) by a process of super-exploitation of labor, due to the connection be- tween low salaries, long hours and intensive work, fol- lowing an industrial pattern typical of a subordinate country. This pattern of accumulation developed strongly, especially from the 1950s to the 1970s.
During the 1980s this process began to experience its ®rst changes. Although, in its basic characteristics, the pattern of accumulation and its ``economic model'' re- main the same, it was possible to see some organiza- tional and technological mutations within the productive process and services, even though, at a much slower rhythm than that experienced by the central countries. This is because, until then, the country was still relatively distant from the process of productive restructuring of capital and from the neo-liberal project, already under way in accentuated rhythm in the ad- vanced capitalist countries.
In the 1980s, the ®rst impulses of the productive re- structuring process in Brazil occurred, leading compa- nies to adopt, initially in a timid and restrictive mode, new organizational and technological patterns. There were also changes in the management patterns of the labor force in Brazilian industry, particularly in the automotive ®eld. The introduction of the ®rst robots, the just-in-time system, production based on team work in the total quality programs, as well as the enlargement of the process of microelectronics di􏰀usion were all observed. So-called ``participative'' methods, that is, mechanisms that seek the ``involvement'' of workers in companies plans, were also slowly initiated 􏰁Alves, 2000; Gitahy and Rabelo, 1991).
A few basic elements should be brought to attention when focusing on the principle causes of the productive restructuring process in Brazil during the 1980s: 􏰁1) the need for Brazilian companies to compete on an inter- national level; 􏰁2) the actions of the transnational com- panies which lead their subsidiaries in Brazil to adopt new organizational and technological patterns that were, to a certain extent, inspired by Toyotism and by  ̄exible forms of accumulation; 􏰁3) the response to the advancement of the new trade unionism 􏰁novo sindical- ismo) that sought to strengthen itself in the work place 􏰁Alves, 2000; Carvalho and Schmitz, 1990).
In the ®rst years of the decade, facing Brazilian eco- nomic recession, the productive restructuring was basi- cally characterized by cost reduction brought about by labor force cutbacks. These particularly a􏰀ected the automotive and autoparts, textile and banking sectors. Due to the 1980/3 recession, the retraction of invest- ments initially slowed the introduction of new micro- electronic technologies, which were to arrive, to a limited extent, from the mid-1980s on. In sum, it can be said that the need to increase productivity occurred mainly through the reorganization of production, the

reduction in the labor force, the increase in the number of hours of the standard work day, the emergence of Quality Control Circles 􏰁QCC), and of the just-in-time and kan-ban production systems. However, it is inter- esting to note that in spite of the tardiness of its pro- ductive restructuring, Brazil was second only to Japan in the number of QCCs in the world in 1982 􏰁see Alves, 2000).
It was only from 1985 on, with the partial recupera- tion of the Brazilian economy, that the new technolog- ical innovations expanded, through the introduction of microelectronic industrial automation in the metal- mechanic, automotive, petrochemical, and steel sectors. In the automotive sector, the installation of new pro- duction lines coexisted with traditional production lines. This relatively high degree of technological heterogene- ity inside the companies came to characterize the pro- ductive restructuring in Brazil 􏰁Alves, 2000).
It was only in the 1990s, however, that the productive capital restructuring was more extensively implemented. Elements such as the so-called Toyotism and the  ̄exible company, lean production, the just-in-time kan-ban system, and the total quality process, were introduced. Also an enormous increase in sub-contracting and third party hiring of the labor force were observed. Another element seen was a process of productive decentraliza- tion characterized by industrial relocation. So-called ``traditional'' sectors such as the shoe industry and the textile industry initiated a movement of geographical changes due to competition from similar products im- ported from China and Southeast Asia 􏰁Alves, 2000). Several shoe factories were transferred from the Franca region, in the interior of the state of S~ao Paulo, and from the Vale do Sinos region, to the states of Cear􏰃a and Bahia, in the northeast of Brazil. By the same token, industries considered to be ``modern'', in the metal- mechanic and electronic sectors, were either transferred from the Greater S~ao Paulo region to areas in the in- terior of the state of S~ao Paulo, such as Rio Claro or S~aoCarlos,orwererelocatedtootherareasofthe country: some were moved to the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro to places like Resende, for instance; others to the interior of Minas Gerais 􏰁Juiz de Fora) or to states like Paran􏰃a, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, etc. 􏰁Alves, 2000).
Within the context of world trade deregulation of the 1990s, the Brazilian automobile industry underwent changes in the policy of import duties. The reduction of tari􏰀s on the importation of vehicles dropped from 80% to 35% in 1990 in the automobile industry and from 60% to 20% in 1994 in the autoparts sector 􏰁Previtalli, 1996). Suppliers then began to intensify the productive re- structuring process through technological innovations involving changes in the layout design, the introduction of robots and CAD/CAM systems, as well as organi- zational changes involving the deverticalization and re-
duction of management hierarchies, and the implementation of new smaller factories structured around production blocks, team work, etc. The oldest production units of Volkswagen, Ford and of Mercedes- Benz, situated in the ABC area of S~ao Paulo, also de- veloped a strong restructuring program such as these, seeking to acquire new technological and production levels 􏰁Previtalli, 1996).
Particularly with the economic stabilization plan, the Real Plan, beginning in 1994 under the government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, total quality programs, the just-in-time and kan-ban systems, and the introduction of salary gains linked to the increased pro®tability and productivity of companies found a promising macroeconomic situation for the develop- ment of productive restructuring. If initially the tech- nological innovations were restricted and separated by sectors, from the mid-1990s on, there was an ampli®- cation of the utilization of automatic microelectronics in the Brazilian production. Expenditure on microelec- tronic automation increased from 16.1% in the period of 1987/89 to 25% in 1993. Thus, if the productive re- structuring process in Brazil was limited and selective during the 1980s being characterized by a restrictive tendency, the 1990s were characterized by intensi®cation in the technical and organizational realms 􏰁see Alves, 2000).
The ®nancial sector also experienced the impacts of the restructuring process. Workers in the banking sector were strongly a􏰀ected by the changes in their work processes, mainly due to microelectronics technology and organizational and administrative innovations. These new administrative policies were instituted mainly in banks, through total quality programs and variable wages. The concession of merit-based incentives to banking managers who exceeded established goals; the development of an e􏰂cient and sophisticated means of communication between the banks and its employees ± by means of the liberal distribution of newsletters, magazines, and videos throughout the workplace; the creation of quality improvement groups in the work- place, as well as widespread teamwork, were increas- ingly used 􏰁Jinkings, 1995, 2000; Segnini, 1998).
The  ̄exible hiring practices of ®nancial institutions through third party contracts, part-time, and temporary employees caused a precarious trend in jobs and salaries, more deregulation of working conditions, and the loss of social rights for third party employees. From the point of view of the ®nancial institutions, these hiring practices provided businesses with enormous pro®ts while at the same time strengthening the capacity of bank management by fragmenting and hindering the organization of labor unions and syndicates. Supported by technological development, these organizational ad- justments greatly reduced the administrative structure and the functional departments of the ®nancial institu-
tions. Computer centers, services and payroll depart- ments were drastically reduced while some whole de- partments were done away with in bank branches and central administrative o􏰂ces. While the economic strength of large private ®nancial conglomerates grew, the number of banking employees was reduced from approximately 800,000 at the end of the 1980s to around 410,000 by the year 2000 􏰁Jinkings, 2000).
As far as the sexual division of labor is concerned, as the banking automatization and  ̄exibilization processes developed, more and more women were hired. However, no egalitarian working conditions between men and women in the banks, either in terms of salary or career plan, were observed. A series of social discriminatory mechanisms ± reproduced and intensi®ed in the working place ± established stronger relations of domination and exploitation of female labor, continuously producing inequality and segmentation between genders 􏰁Segnini, 1998; Jinkings, 2000).
The above-mentioned changes related to personal and professional characteristics of bank workers ex- pressing the on-going productive restructuring and labor automation and rationalization. Aiming at adequating its labor force to the present modalities of the produc- tive process, ®nancing institutions require ``new quali- ®cations'' for workers in this sector. Embedded in a context of growing unemployment and facing increas- ingly precarious contracting forms, banking employees are compelled to develop general and multiple skills in order to try to keep their jobs and be promoted in their careers. Under such working conditions, which exclude enormous portions of workers from the labor market, bank workers have to submit themselves to overloaded and extenuating working journeys. In the last decades, these workers' health problems have been aggravated and there has been an unprecedented increase in carpal tunnel syndrome, which reduces muscular strength and impairs movements for those who su􏰀er from its symptoms. The widespread total quality and variable wages programs also recreate strategies of labor domi- nation which seek to obscure labor and capital relations. Bank workers are considered to be ``members'', ``part- ners'', ``collaborators'' of banks and ®nancing institu- tion 􏰁see Jinkings, 2000).
The above examples of banking and automotive productive restructuring processes have, together with many others, signi®cantly altered the labor structure in Brazil. According to Pochmann 􏰁2000), in the 1970s ± at the peak of industrial employment expansion ± Brazil had about 20% of its total job positions in the industrial sector, whereas 20 years later, i.e., in the 1990s, this very same industrial sector absorbed less than 13% of the total national job occupations. As a result of the process of economical reconversion, Brazil, starting in 1990, registered new tendencies in terms of professional oc- cupations: due to ``changes in industrial dynamics in
which the internal market motivation depended on a greater external competitive insertion, the national economy had, for the ®rst time since the 30s, to begin to deal with absolute and relative loss of job positions in manufacturing industry. Within the 1980s and the 1990s, for instance, the Brazilian economy lost approx- imately 1.5 million job positions in the manufacturing sector'' 􏰁see Pochmann, 2000, p. 26). With the retraction of industrial employment between 1970 and 1990, ser- vices increased their relative participation in the occu- pational structure on average by 50%, for the most part it was the informal sector that incorporated large number of workers, above all in commerce, communi- cations and transport. According to Pochmann 􏰁2000, p. 27): ``In the 1990s, services took up more job posts, without taking into account however the destruction of jobs as much in the rural sector as in the industrial sector. Nowadays, the rise in the open unemployment rate re ̄ects, indeed, the incapacity of the Brazilian economy to produce signi®cant new posts, in spite of the fact that the service industry continues to absorb part of the workers that annually enter the job market or are ®red from the industrial and agricultural sectors''.
When compared to the volume of world unemploy- ment, in 1999 Brazil was in third place in the volume of unemployment, representing 5.61% of the total global unemployment, and its active economic population represented 3.12% of the worldwide global active eco- nomic population. In 1986, Brazil ranked 13th in global unemployment, representing 2.75% of the world AEP and 1.68% of world unemployment. 􏰁Pochmann, 2000).
Indeed, during the 1990s, this process intensi®ed so that it now permits assuming that more recent impacts have been more signi®cant. There has been a combina- tion of enormous reduction in the labor force with mutations in the productive process. Flexibilization and deregulation and the new forms of administration of the labor force are present with great intensity, although indications are that Fordism is still dominant and also mixed with the new productive processes. If it is true that low wages for the labor force ± which was always characterized as an attracting factor for the in ̄ux of foreign productive capital in Brazil ± may constitute, in some productive areas, an element that could hinder, in part, technological capitalist advances, in the same way the combination resulting from the super-exploitation of the labor force, with some of the more advanced pro- ductive patterns, constituted a central element of new rounds of investment of capital. In reality, what is of interest for productive capital is the con ̄uence of a ``quali®ed labor force'' prepared to work with micro- electronic equipment, increasingly lower wages and the conditions to place the labor force in a precarious situ- ation.
Countries like Brazil are experiencing moments of rede®nition along with the international division of

quences for the trade unions and social movement.
3. The ``Response'' from Brazilian trade union
In the 1980s, Brazilian unionism experienced a par- ticularly positive moment. There was a widespread and highly signi®cant strike movement among various seg- ments of the labor force, such as salaried rural workers 􏰁``boias-frias''), public employees, diverse sectors of middle salaried workers, etc. There were, too, general category strikes 􏰁bank employees in 1995), strikes with workers' occupation of the factories 􏰁as in General Motors in S~ao Jos􏰃e dos Campos in 1985 and the Companhia Sideru􏰃rgica Nacional in Volta Redonda in 1989), innumerous strikes in speci®c ®rms, culminating in national general strikes, as in March 1989, which included about 35 million workers, the largest strike to have occurred in the history of the country 􏰁Table 1; see also Antunes, 1994).
There was a substantial union expansion to include mid-level workers and those in service sectors, such as bank employees, teachers, doctors, public employees, etc. that grew signi®cantly during this period. By the end of the 1980s, there was a total of 9833 unions in Brazil, a numberthatwastoreachabout15,972bythemid-1990s 􏰁urban and rural, employers' and workers' trade un- ions). Urban trade unions totaled 10,779. There was also an increase in the number of mid-level salaried workers. In 1996, there were 1335 public employees' unions, 461 unions linked to the so-called ``liberal professions'' and 572 of self-employed workers 􏰁Source: Labor Ministry, Brazil, 1996). Rural unionism continued to advance, rising since the 1970s, permitting an organizational re- structuring of farm workers and, later, the birth of the MST 􏰁The Landless Rural Workers' Movement). In 1996, there were 5193 rural unions, of which 3098 were workers' unions 􏰁Tables 2 and 3).
These points, mentioned above, make it possible to a􏰂rm that there was a real advance in the new unionism during the 1980s. Overall, this decade saw positive re- sults. There was a widespread and highly signi®cant

strike movement; a notable expansion of trade unions organizing salaried sectors 􏰁teachers, bank workers, public sector workers, etc.); the advance of rural unionism, which had been on the ascent since the 1970s, continued; there was also the rise of the Union Con- gressessuchastheCUT-CentralU􏰃nicadosTrabalha- dores 􏰁Workers Central). Also, although very tentatively, there was an attempt to organize the work- place 􏰁a long-lasting weakness of Brazilian unionism); an e􏰀ective struggle for union autonomy and for free- dom from state intervention; and an increase in the number of trade unions, such as in the public service sector. In all, throughout this decade there was a general increase in membership, creating a favorable context for the new unionism 􏰁see Antunes, 1994).
While during the 1980s, Brazilian unionism went, in good measure, against the current of the critical ten- dencies present in unions in the advanced capitalist countries, in the last years of the decade, however, economic, political and ideological pressures had al- ready began to arise, taking Brazilian trade unionism, in the 1990s, through a regressive movement. The muta-
tions in the productive process and in the restructuring of business, as well as administration and control of the labor force, developed within a context of economic recession, launched a process of casualization of im- portant contingents of workers, and, particularly, in the intensi®cation of the unemployment of the labor force, of which the automobile industry is a good example. While in the ABC Paulista 􏰁the industrial cities sur- rounding the S~ao Paulo City) there were, at the end of the 1980s, approximately 220,000 metalworkers, this contingent diminished by nearly 110,000 by the end of the 1990s. In the industrial region of Campinas, in the stateofS~aoPaulo,therewereapproximately70,000 industrial workers, with this number being reduced to about 34,000 metalworkers in 2000. The number of bank workers also declined, as we have previously no- ted, following the restructuring of banks and the in- creased use of technology.
This new reality made new unionism weaker and more defensive, ®nding itself, on one side, faced with the emergence of neo-liberal unionism, in tune with the conservative wave world-wide, of which the Forßca Sin- dical 􏰁association of unions created in 1991) is the best example. On the other side, it faced directions occurring within CUT, that make it enormously di􏰂cult to have any qualitative advance capable of making the transi- tion from a period of resistance, as in the initial years of the new unionism, to a higher level, that of the elabo- ration of alternative economic proposals, contrary to the capitalist pattern of development existing in Brazil, which would be concerned ®rst and foremost with the range of sectors which compose our working class.
The situation today is di􏰂cult. The unionism of the Forßca Sindical, with its strong political and ideological dimensions, ®lls the union camp of the new right, of the preservation of order, of harmony with the designs of globalized capital, which leaves to Brazil the role of assembler, without our own technology, without scien- ti®c capacity, totally dependent upon external resources. Forßca Sindical has been strongly favorable to the trend of privatization of public businesses and of the restric- tion of social and welfare rights of public employees.
Within CUT, the scene is also one of great appre- hension. Some of the principal leaders are increasingly assuming a posture of abandoning socialist conception, in the name of accepting Order. The cult of negotiation, the creation of ``sectional councils'' 􏰁bargaining between capital and labor) in the automotive sector and in other productive branches at the beginning of the 1990s, the reduction in the work week accompanied by salary re- duction, among other examples, all this is basically in- serted into a project designed by the set of ideas and practices of social-democratic unionism, that has little by little adapted to a bureaucratic vertical structure, with decision-making at the top, that characterized Brazilian unionism in the post-1930s.
In the more left-wing sectors within CUT, the di􏰂- culties are also enormous. How is it possible to elaborate an alternative economic and political program that in- corporates the millions of workers who do not partici- pate in the market and who live in the misery of the informal economy? How is it possible to administer a new economic model that eliminates the super-exploi- tation of labor, that develops a particular Brazilian in- dustrial capitalism, when the monthly minimum wage, at about US$ 80 in 2000, reaches such degrading levels? What are the basic features of this alternative economic model whose logic should be to begin the dismantling of the pattern of accumulation present in the country? How is it possible to think of an action that does not impede technological advance, but makes it on a real basis, with leading edge science and technology devel- oped in the country, in an autonomous way and directed to the most profound needs of the working population? How is it possible to travel an alternative road that does not accept globalization and integration imposed by the logic of capital, integrating outward and disintegrating inward? How is it possible today to articulate values inspired in a project that has to give immediate re- sponses for the misery that ravages the daily lives of those who live o􏰀 work? In other words, how do you ®nd the di􏰂cult yet vital articulation between immediate interests and long-term strategic action, capable of of- fering more worthy conditions to the majority of the Brazilian population?
While during the 1980s, Brazilian trade unionism, as I said previously, went against the tide of the critical tendencies present in trade unionism of the more ad- vanced capitalist countries, by the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the new unionism emphatically addressed itself to the enormous challenges presented to the larger trade union movement, in a number of countries at the end of the 20th century. To summarize these challenges, which we understand to be present for unionist movements of various countries, we pose the following questions:
Are the unions capable of breaking the enormous social barrier that separates ``stable'' workers, in a dramatic process of reduction, with those part-time workers or those in the so-called ``informal economy'', which is dramatically expanding? Will they be able to assist with the union organization of the disorganized and unemployed, and in this way try to reverse the rates of de-unionization present in the principal capitalist economies? Are they capable of breaking with the new corporatism, which exclusively defends its respective professional categories, abandoning or radically dimin- ishing its more accentuated class concepts? Here, I do not mean a state corporatism, present in recent history, in Brazil since Vargas, in Argentina since Peronism, or even in Mexico since Cardenas, but that of a more re- cent social neo-corporatism which is excluding, biased

and which maintains and accentuates the fragmented character of that class which lives from its labor. Will they be able to break with the growing tendency of ex- cessive institutionalization and bureaucracy, that has so strongly marked the union movement on the global scale and distanced it from its social base, increasing the gap between the union institutions and autonomous social movements? Will they reverse the tendency, de- veloped from Japanese ``Toyotism'', and today ad- vanced on a global scale that consists of restricting the trade union to the exclusive bounds of the factory, the so-called business unionism more vulnerable and linked to business interests and tied to business control? And ®nally, will the trade unions have the force and vitality to break the existing barrier between the unionist and parliamentary actions, between economic and political actions, and instead articulate and join social, extra- parliamentary struggles that give life to class actions, with its actions within the institutional arena, which are important but clearly secondary in relation to the ®rst?
While these are not questions with simple answers, there are new sectors of Brazilian unionism that have sought to respond to some of these challenges. The Steel Trade Union of the Region of Campinas ± an important industrial area in the state of S~ao Paulo where there have been recent installations of Toyota and Honda plants ± has been responsible for a resistance movement and labor organization in both the factories and the employee neighborhoods. In the region of Campinas, Toyota su􏰀ered two strikes within its ®rst two years of installation. The action of the Steel Trade Union of the Region of Campinas is an example of resistance to the multiple forms of involvement and partnership that have been intensely developing within Brazilian unionism. Currently, this union, led by Catholic and Socialist workers, originated from the community bases of the Catholic church, refused to follow the example of the ``sectional councils'' of the ABC region in S~ao Paulo, considering them as a form of subordination and loss of class independence. Similarly, the Steel Trade Union of S~aoJos􏰃edosCampos,S~aoPaulo,anotherimportant industrial site where General Motors of Brazil is cur- rently located, has ful®lled a role of resistance and preservation of workers' rights, leading to union strug- gles and strong confrontations. Together, these two unions are prime examples of the leftist urban syndicates found nowadays in Brazil. The National Union of Pe- troleum Workers 􏰁named Federaß~o 􏰃nica dos Petro- leiros ± FUP) was responsible for one of the most important strikes in Brazil, in 1995, during which workers strongly protested against the privatization of the state-owned company Petrobr􏰃s and the government of Fernado Henrique Cardoso. Other examples can be cited, such as the various strikes and resistance move- ments that broke out during the 1990s. But throughout the decade, it was in the rural areas that the most im-
portant social and political movement of the country emerged: the MST.
4. The meaning of MST 􏰁The landless rural workers' movement) and new social movements in Brazil
Having emerged in 1984 as a consequence of the enormous disparities in land ownership in Brazil and as a result of the agro-industrial modernization process, the MST is illustrative of the possibilities of social movements and even of the new unionism in contem- porary Brazil. It is becoming the most important social and political movement in Brazil, resurrecting, with force and vitality, the struggle of the rural workers that is at the center of the Brazilian political struggle. As the main catalyst and propellant of the recent rural social struggles and being the most important opposition movement to the Fernando Henrique Cardoso govern- ment, the MST is characterized as a social±political movement whose centrality is found in its grassroots action, in democratic decisions in rural settlements, aimed at obtaining possession of land and at agrarian reform, giving greater priority to confrontation than to institutional or parliamentary action. These are also used, but on a secondary level. It is worth remembering that in Brazil about 1% of the population controls ap- proximately 46% of the land, a signi®cant example of agrarian concentration and profound exclusion of rural workers in relation to land ownership.
The MST, although a social±political movement born in the rural world, has increasingly incorporated the excluded urban worker, the urban unemployed, who in the past years or decades had migrated from the coun- tryside to the cities and now, without work, inverts the migratory  ̄ow, returning to the countryside, expelled by the restructuring process of productive capital. This has generated a movement that is rich in experience and cosmopolitan, since it articulates experiences and forms of sociability native to the world of work, both rural and urban.
Founded in the con ̄uence of leftist Catholic action, linked with the Theology of Liberation and organized in grassroots ecclesiastical communities of the Catholic Church, with strongly inspired Marxist and socialist elements, the MST ®nds vitality in its strong grassroots national structure. This gives it dynamism and permits workers, male and female, to imagine a day-to-day life with meaning through obtaining land and through the democratic and popular practices resulting from pro- ductive collective action.
According to Joao Pedro Stedile, a member of the MST National Committee and the movement's main leader, ``The MST was born in practice more than 15 years ago. In our development, we had a ®rst period, from 1979±1983, of the reestablishment of massive
struggles for land, when many land occupations and other mobilizations spread to several regions in the country, however isolated from each other. Only after a long process of mutual knowledge, of articulation be- tween the leaders of these localized struggles, the MST was constituted as a national movement with the real- ization of a Encontro National dos Sem Terra, in Jan- uary 1984, in Cascavel, Parana, with representatives of 16 states'' 􏰁Stedile, 1997, p. 102).
As there are approximately 4.8 million landless fam- ilies in Brazil, the struggle for land has intensi®ed, in particular since the MST was structured nationally. While in 1987, there were 1849 families which partici- pated in the land occupations in Brazil, in 1997 this number had risen to 58.226 􏰁see Table 4).
In the 1990s, the MST became the main catalyst and drive behind the recent social struggle in Brazil and through the strong links they have with social urban sectors ± some of which are linked to syndicates and some not ± they have helped to encourage joint actions between unions, social movements and student move- ments. Its importance originates from the fact that the pivot of its performance is pointed toward the social movement of rural workers, for their social base, not emphasizing its action in the institutional or parlia- mentary scope. The institutional and parliamentary ac- tion realized by the MST is always a consequence of the social-based actions, marked by occupation of lands, sit- ins, and popular public manifestations of great ampli- tude and breadth, ascribing the MST with great force and vitality. Due to the brutal social inequalities of the country, there is an obvious fountain of social force to be organized by the MST.
Having strong ties with the social movement and urban trade unions, the action of the MST had in- creasingly shown itself to be an alternative capable of in ̄uencing the organization of urban workers, as is the case for the Movement to dos Sem-Teto 􏰁Movement of the Homeless). Recently, in August of 2000, the Move- ment of the Homeless in the state of Rio de Janeiro was responsible for an action that caused enormous social
Table 4 Occupation of land ± number of families ± 1987/1997
and political impact in Brazil: dozens of homeless workers and their families ``visited'' an upper middle class shopping center in Rio. A few days later, another ``shopping visit'' followed, this time to a supermarket in the same city: the homeless ``paid'' their expenses with a symbolic cheque to the value of R$ 169,000 reais, an amount corresponding to the claimed sum related to the most recent case of public corruption in Brazil involving the construction of a public building and the judicial branch of the government.
Through such actions, this recent Homeless Move- ment brought out the wastefulness and super ̄uous so- cial wickedness that characterizes Brazilian society. It is important to note that according to information from the IBGE, in 1999 there were 7.6 million unemployed workers, while in 1995 they totaled 4.5 million. The o􏰂cial rate of unemployment increased from 6.1% to 9.6%. If we consider the ®gures given out by an im- portant entity such as DIEESE 􏰁Departamento Inter- sindical ed Estatisticas e Estudos Socio-Economicos), the levels of unemployment are double the o􏰂cial ®g- ures for the principle cities of the country, such as Rio de Janeiro and S~ao Paulo.
Nowadays, according to the data published in 2000, the economically active population in Brazil totals 71 million workers, while only 24 million, or one-third, are found in the formal job market. The majority, totaling 37 million, or the remaining 2/3 of the work force, is found in the informal market, without social rights, without ®xed salaries, working part-time, or on tempo- rary and uncertain jobs. It is known that these indices tend to rise, increasing the uncertainty of workers in the informal market 􏰁Pochmann, 2000).
In a decade of so many transformations and so much poverty ± a consequence of the productive restructuring as much as of the implementation of neoliberal policies ± work precariousness and unemployment have grown signi®cantly. As a result of these previously mentioned processes, the reduction of formal employment and the expansion of informal employment ± de®ning elements in Brazilian economic policy ± the number of unem- ployed workers was remarkably enlarged. If unions are presently undergoing operational di􏰂culties, through their reorganization and retrenchment plans, many so- cial urban movements have been started or revitalized, such as the movement of the homeless workers.
What these new social urban movements denounce is clear: the same society that produces super ̄uous con- sumer goods and at the same time generates and stim- ulates multiple consumer needs, makes it impossible for large contingents of poor or unemployed workers to consume these very same goods. As a participant of the Homeless Movement in Rio de Janeiro clearly stated: ``If it is us that build the shopping centers, why can't we even visit them?'' This question is a clear response to the logic of current society: those who construct and

produce wealth in society cannot, even marginally, enjoy its results. They are excluded from consumption as well as from work.
Thus, the new urban and rural social movements that are growing in so many parts of the world begin to show the society its own destructive logic, with its consequent inequalities and wickednesses. It is in this ``disposable society'' ± a producer of the disposable and of the su- per ̄uous in this era of the entertaining society 􏰁with its shopping centers, the true temple of capital consump- tion), men and women without homes and without jobs, the ownerless of the ®elds and cities, take their actions in various parts of Brazil. And strong signs are being given that in the next decade they will be developing, strengthening and enlarging their a􏰂rmative actions.
Recently in Brazil, we are witnessing a blooming of actions that emerge from labor from social forces and from the victims of this destructive logic that only weakens the workers movement and increases unem- ployment. The advancement of the MST, the most sig- ni®cant social and political movement in Brazil during the 1990s, is an example of such actions. So are the new social urban movements that have recently emerged and that argue against the waste and super ̄uidity which characterize contemporary society. The greater their ties with the trade unions and CUT, the more their experi- ences will help in the revival of the trade unions in con- temporary Brazil at the beginning of the 21st century.
